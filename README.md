# Example Voting App (Result App in React)

This is a forked repo of [dockersamples/example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app). 
I've reprogrammed the frontend app "result" from [Angular.js](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/tree/main/result) to [React](https://github.com/qoosdd89382/example-voting-app/tree/main/result-react), so it's highly recommended to check out the original repo for the full instructions.
